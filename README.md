🎯 Guess the Number - Python Game
A simple and fun terminal-based game built with Python where the computer picks a random number and you try to guess it! Great for beginners learning Python basics like loops, conditionals, and user input.

🕹️ How to Play
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.

You have to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.

After each guess, the game will tell you whether your guess was too high, too low, or correct.

Once guessed, it displays the number of attempts and gives you the option to play again.
